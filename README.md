Business Requirement Report for Blinkit Analysis
1. Project Overview
The Blinkit Analysis project aims to perform a comprehensive analysis of Blinkit's sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution. This analysis is intended to uncover key insights and identify opportunities for optimization using various KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and visualizations developed in Power BI.

2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The KPIs essential to this analysis focus on evaluating different aspects of sales and customer satisfaction. These KPIs will provide a quantitative measure of performance and will guide optimization strategies. The following KPIs are identified as critical:

2.1 Total Sales
Objective: Measure the overall revenue generated from all items sold.
2.2 Average Sales
Objective: Calculate the average revenue per sale.
2.3 Number of Items
Objective: Count the total number of different items sold.
2.4 Average Rating
Objective: Assess the average customer rating for items sold.
3. Chart Requirements
To present the KPI data effectively, various types of charts and visualizations will be employed. Each chart is designed to highlight specific relationships and insights from the dataset:

3.1 Total Sales by Fat Content
Objective: Analyze the impact of fat content on total sales.
Additional KPI Metrics: Assess how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with fat content.
Chart Type: Donut Chart.
3.2 Total Sales by Item Type
Objective: Identify the performance of different item types in terms of total sales.
Additional KPI Metrics: Assess how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with item type.
Chart Type: Bar Chart.
3.3 Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales
Objective: Compare total sales across different outlets segmented by fat content.
Additional KPI Metrics: Assess how other KPIs (Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) vary with fat content.
Chart Type: Stacked Column Chart.
3.4 Total Sales by Outlet Establishment
Objective: Evaluate how the age or type of outlet establishment influences total sales.
Additional KPI Metrics: Examine how other metrics fluctuate with different outlet establishments.
Chart Type: Line Chart.
